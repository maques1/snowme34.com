   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Docsnt
==================================

Docsnt (pronounce as "doc sent") is just a combination of "doc" and my name.

This is a personal web page using `Readthedocs <https://readthedocs.org/>`_
and `Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ documenting something fun (I think)
to share.

Please refer to the table of contents below and in the sidebar for your topic
of interest. You can also use the search function in the top left corner.

.. note:: This is a personal wiki-like place. There is no guarantee about anything.
          Please contact me if you spot any errors or you just want to talk.
