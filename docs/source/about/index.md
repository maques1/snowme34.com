I love collecting and organizing.

I have shot more than 40,000 photos and videos and they are all
organized ideally, i.e. I can retrieve any one of them based on
any feature (theme, topic, people, date, place, etc.) given
in no more than 3 operations.

I have written and collected (clipped) more than 4,000 notes in
Evernote. Perhaps I am not expert of any of them, but at least
I know where to find the "output" of experts.

There is no advertising plan (yet). It is expected that only at
most 2 or 3 web spiders will visit here monthly.

And, it's not a good habit to write documents in Markdown!
The articles here are mostly in markdown since they are easy
to migrate to other platforms!
