# OSI Model Layer 1

## First Layer

The physical layer that is responsible for binary transmission.

Define how transmission is achieved.

## Layer 1 Equipments

Use cables to connect.

Different network uses some medium to communicate.

* Network interface controller (NIC)
* Repeater
* Ethernet hub
* Modem
* Fiber media converter

### Network Interface Controller (NIC)

For layer 1

Some network interface controllers might also support functionalities
of layer 2 and layer 3.

### Ethernet Media

Example:

`10 BASE T`

It means, the speed is 100 M, uses baseband transmission, and twisted-pair cable.

Tx: twisted-air
Fx: fiber
Lx: long

### Twisted-Pair Cable

There are 8 wires, 4 pairs, and an outer jacket for a Twisted-Pair cable.

2 types of twisted-pair cables:

* Unshielded Twisted-Pair Cable (UTP)
  * more common
* Shielded Twisted-Pair Cable (STP)
  * more expensive
  * harder to connect

### RJ-45 Connector

The register jet

Has 8 pins.

### RJ-45 Jack

A slot to plug in connector

### Wiring

* 568A
* 568B

### Straight-Through and Crossover

Straight-Through

* Same wiring on both ends

Crossover

* Different wiring on both ends
* 1326

Use crossover for devices with same type

Use Straight-Through for devices with different order.

So that both sending and receiving can be done in the same time.
